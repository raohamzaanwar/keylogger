Python Keylogger
Overview
This repository contains Python code for a simple keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes on both Windows and Linux platforms. A keylogger is a tool that records (logs) the keys pressed on a keyboard, which can be used for troubleshooting, monitoring, or educational purposes.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This keylogger is created for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers to capture user input can violate privacy laws. Ensure you have explicit permission before using it on any system.

Features
Windows Keylogger:

Logs all key presses.
Hides the console window for silent execution.
Saves key logs to a hidden C:\output.txt file.
Stops keylogging when Ctrl + E is pressed.
Linux Keylogger:

Logs all key presses.
Saves key logs to ~/Desktop/file.log.
Stops keylogging by pressing the backtick (`) key.
Option to clear the log file on startup through environment variables.
Prerequisites
For Windows:
Install pywin32 to access the Windows API:
Copy code
pip install pywin32
Install pyHook to hook keyboard events:
Copy code
pip install pyHook
For Linux:
Install python-Xlib to hook into X11 keyboard events:
arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python-xlib
Install pyxhook to capture keyboard events:
Copy code
pip install pyxhook
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Install Dependencies:
Use the commands listed in the Prerequisites section to install the required libraries based on your platform.
Usage
Running the Keylogger on Windows:
Save the code in the repository as Keylogger.py in the C:\ directory.
Run the keylogger using:
Copy code
python Keylogger.py
The keylogger will run in the background, and keystrokes will be logged to C:\output.txt.
To stop the keylogger, press Ctrl + E.
Running the Keylogger on Linux:
Save the Linux keylogger code as keylogger.py.
Run the keylogger using:
Copy code
python keylogger.py
The keylogger will log all key presses to ~/Desktop/file.log.
Press the backtick (`) key to stop the keylogger.
Code Explanation
Windows Keylogger
Hides Console Window: The console window is hidden using win32gui.ShowWindow(win, 0) to ensure the keylogger runs silently.
Keystroke Logging: The pyHook library captures and logs keystrokes, which are saved to C:\output.txt.
Exit Mechanism: The script stops when Ctrl + E (ASCII 5) is pressed.
Linux Keylogger
Keystroke Logging: The pyxhook library is used to capture keystrokes, which are saved to ~/Desktop/file.log.
Exit Mechanism: The keylogger stops when the backtick (`) key is pressed.
Clear Logs on Startup: The log file can be cleared on startup by setting the pylogger_clean environment variable.
